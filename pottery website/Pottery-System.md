# Pottery System

**Pottery System** is an online marketplace tailored for pottery enthusiasts. The platform allows artisans to upload and showcase their unique pottery designs, while customers can easily browse, select, and purchase these handcrafted items. The website features a vintage, old-school design to echo the traditional art of pottery.

This project is a culmination of my work in PHP and SQL, tying together the key concepts of web development and database management to create a functional e-commerce platform.
